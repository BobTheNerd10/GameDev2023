        Prove the elegance of classes!!
        Object oriented programming is AWESOME and is ELEGANT (if you know how to use it)

        Make classes for several different animals using extend
            access parent's methods and parameters using super (it's like base in c#)

        Have things that effect EVERYTHING with static

        private and public

        Getters and setters

        
        Make sure to telll ellis that extend is on the web page

        NOTE TO SELF ^^this^^ is super overkill
