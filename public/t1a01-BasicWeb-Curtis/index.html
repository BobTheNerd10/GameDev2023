        Stageplay idea:
            Intro: 
            - "Please open in full screen for the full experience" (have it say thank you when the window is fullscreened)
            - Site opens up like a stageplay with lights that turn on (it only does it upon first open though, not on refresh)
            - Title card that says "Video flac" in a fun way (it's a poster thing that's hanging from the ceiling before it quickly ropes back upward)
            - The carts roll in from stage right

            Carts:
            - Intro cart that explains what exactly this website is
            - V cart (variables) there's a text entry that falls into a box
