    <subtitle>Several basic elements of the web as well as a write-up on VIDEO-FLAC<subtitle>
    
    <main>
        <h1>Typical Elements you may see on the web.</h1>
        <p>
            HTML has <i><b>A LOT</b></i> of different elements! They provide the functionality for several websites you may be familiar with, such as 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>!    
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the sentence above contains &lt;p&gt; (paragrpah tag), &lt;i&gt; (italics), &lt;b&gt; (bold), and &lt;a&gt; (links)! <b style="color:red;"><i><u>You can also get creative and combine them to make monstrosities like this!</u></i></b> 
            However, you probably shouldn't do that because it looks awful and can be confused for links.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Another element type are headings! 
        </h3>
        <h1 style="display:inline; margin-block:0;">h1</h1>
        <h2 style="display:inline; margin-block:0;">h2</h2>
        <h3 style="display:inline; margin-block:0;">h3</h3>
        <h4 style="display:inline; margin-block:0;">h4</h4>
        <h5 style="display:inline; margin-block:0;">h5</h5>
        <h6 style="display:inline; margin-block:0;">h6 hehe this one is so tiny :></h6>
        </h6>
        <h3>
            You can <u>also</u> put <i>styling</i> in headers! <s>Including strikethrough</s>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Lastly for cool text styling elements, another thing you may have noticed are the colours on some bits of text. &lt;a&gt; adds colouring automatically, but you can also use CSS and do it yourself to create... <b><u><red>r</red><orange>a</orange><yellow>i</yellow><green>n</green><turquoise>b</turquoise><blue>o</blue><indigo>w</indigo><purple>s</purple><darkPurple>!</darkPurple></u></b>
        </p>
        <span>As for uncool text styling elements, this segment of text is divided up into 4 &lt;span&gt;s. It </span>
        <span>lets you display text inline! Although in reality it's just </span>
        <span>an empty tag with no code attatched to it, so while you can do stuff like <span class="wave1">T</span><span class="wave2">H</span><span class="wave3">I</span><span class="wave4">S</span> with spans, there's not much reason to </span>
        <span>use it since you can do it with other tags (the rainbow was done with custom tags, not spans)</span>

        <p>Use CSS animate to do stuff like this:</p>
        <h2>
            <span class="biggerWave1">B</span>
            <span class="biggerWave2">I</span>
            <span class="biggerWave3">G</span>
            <span class="biggerWave4">W</span>
            <span class="biggerWave5">A</span>
            <span class="biggerWave6">V</span>
            <span class="biggerWave7">E</span>
            <span class="biggerWave8">!</span>
            <span class="biggerWave9">!</span>
        </h2>

        <p class="spinny">
            spinny
        </p>


        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <marquee>Scrolling text :D</marquee>
        <p>
            This scrolling text here is a marquee! Pretty neat, huh? They've mostly fallen out of fashion in web development now because of how annoying they look, but they used to be
            a much bigger part of the web. It's like a news ticker! You can also put images in them to make them look EXTRA annoying! (but i've spared you of that because it's incredibly distracting)
        </p>
        <br>

        <div>
            One last thing to note of is &lt;div&gt;s! Divs let you divide up your webpage and add lots of cool CSS and JS to them! 
            As useful as divs are, you can use most HTML tags to serve the same purpose (this page is divided up into &lt;header&gt; and &lt;main&gt;, 
            which all do the exact same things as div, but they make your code a lot more readable and are good practice! Typically you'll also see &lt;footer&gt;, 
            but that's not used on this web page because this page has no footer.) They're very common in web page development, so it's 
            worth mentioning them as one of the basic elements as the web! 
        </div>

        <p>
            The divider line below this bit of text is called an &lt;hr&gt;! They're pretty nifty for making your web page's content look nice :D 
        </p>

        <h3>Javascript stuff (VIDEO-FLAC)</h3>
        <p>
            This is just a small writeup on each thing in VIDEO-FLAC. This is where the page gets boring so feel free to skip it.
        </p>        

        <!--Implement me later

            V:
                V stands for variables. Any programming language that can label a part of system RAM with a name and regularly access the value put there has variables 
                (Almost every language except low level ones like Assembly or IL (it's part of C#))! Many different programming languages handle variables differently,
                so this write up will focus on Javascript because that's what this course uses! 

                Javascript has 3 ways to define variables. LET, VAR, and CONST

                LET is the typical variable definition you'll see most often, and it's very simple in how it works! You just say "let x = 2;", and now the computer is
                storing the integer "2" in variable X! You can change it and use it in place of arguments in functions as well!

                VAR is extremely similar to LET, but it's used much less often because it's confusing. VAR does the exact same thing as LET except that JS acts like the
                variable was defined at the top of the file. Don't worry if that sounds stupid (it's because it is), ALWAYS try and use LET since it makes your code make
                MUCH more sense and will save you time in the long run.

                CONST is *kind of* similar to LET. It's more similar to compile time variables in C or C++ if you're familiar with those. It's shorthand for "constant",
                It stores values like LET, but it can NEVER BE CHANGED! It's very helpful for developer settings and debugging things. It's like a config file built into
                js! However, it's also quite useless to the average user (users rarely need constants). Use these if you want to have an easily enabled "debug mode" for
                example.

            I:
                I stands for input (although outputs are grouped with it in the lesson)

                Inputs change your website from active to *inter*active! They're the gateway for any users to input data into your website! They're used ALL OVER the web
                (Search bars, logins, buttons that run Javascript code, etc). Outputs are what you use to return data back to the user.

            D:
                D stands for decisions

            E:
                E stands for events

            O:
                O stands for objects (sepcifically Javascript objects, they're different from objects in languages like C#)

            F:
                F stands for functions

            L:
                L stands for Loops

            A:
                A stands for Arrays

            C:
                C stands for classes
