        <p>All about very common elements on the web</p>
        <p>
            HTML has <i><b>A LOT</b></i> of different elements! They provide the functionality for several websites you may be familiar with, such as 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>!    
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the sentence above contains &lt;p&gt; (paragrpah tag), &lt;i&gt; (italics), &lt;b&gt; (bold), and &lt;a&gt; (links)! <b style="color:red;"><i><u>You can also get creative and combine them to make monstrosities like this!</u></i></b> 
            However, you probably shouldn't do that because it looks awful and can be confused for links.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Another element type are headings! 
        </h3>
        <h1 class="headingRow">h1</h1>
        <h2 class="headingRow">h2</h2>
        <h3 class="headingRow">h3</h3>
        <h4 class="headingRow">h4</h4>
        <h5 class="headingRow">h5</h5>
        <h6 class="headingRow">h6 hehe this one is so tiny :></h6>
        </h6>
        <h3>
            You can <u>also</u> put <i>styling</i> in headers! <s>Including strikethrough</s>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Lastly for cool text styling elements, another thing you may have noticed are the colours on some bits of text. &lt;a&gt; adds colouring automatically, but you can also use CSS and do it yourself to create... <b><u><red>r</red><orange>a</orange><yellow>i</yellow><green>n</green><turquoise>b</turquoise><blue>o</blue><indigo>w</indigo><purple>s</purple><darkPurple>!</darkPurple></u></b>
        </p>
        <span>As for uncool text styling elements, this segment of text is divided up into 4 &lt;span&gt;s. It </span>
        <span>lets you display text inline! Although in reality it's just </span>
        <span>an empty tag with no code attatched to it, so while you can do stuff like <span class="wave1">T</span><span class="wave2">H</span><span class="wave3">I</span><span class="wave4">S</span> with spans, there's not much reason to </span>
        <span>use it since you can do it with other tags (the rainbow was done with custom tags, not spans)</span>

        <p>Use CSS animate to do stuff like this:</p>
        <h2>
            <span class="biggerWave1">B</span>
            <span class="biggerWave2">I</span>
            <span class="biggerWave3">G</span>
            <span class="biggerWave4">W</span>
            <span class="biggerWave5">A</span>
            <span class="biggerWave6">V</span>
            <span class="biggerWave7">E</span>
            <span class="biggerWave8">!</span>
            <span class="biggerWave9">!</span>
        </h2>

        <p class="spinny">
            spinny
        </p>


        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <marquee>Scrolling text :D</marquee>
        <p>
            This scrolling text here is a marquee! Pretty neat, huh? They've mostly fallen out of fashion in web development now because of how annoying they look, but they used to be
            a much bigger part of the web. It's like a news ticker! You can also put images in them to make them look EXTRA annoying! (but i've spared you of that because it's incredibly distracting)
        </p>
        <br>

        <div id="div-flashing">
            One last thing to note of is &lt;div&gt;s! Divs let you divide up your webpage and add lots of cool CSS and JS to them! 
            As useful as divs are, you can use most HTML tags to serve the same purpose (this page is divided up into &lt;header&gt; and &lt;main&gt;, 
            which all do the exact same things as div, but they make your code a lot more readable and are good practice! Typically you'll also see &lt;footer&gt;, 
            but that's not used on this web page because this page has no footer.) They're very common in web page development, so it's 
            worth mentioning them as one of the basic elements as the web! 

            This blinking div was done with CSS animate.
        </div>

        <p>
            The divider line below this bit of text is called an &lt;hr&gt;! They're pretty nifty for making your web page's content look nice :D 
        </p>

        <div style="display:none">
            <div id="V">
                V stands for variables. Almost every programming language has variables, but many different programming languages handle variables differently.<br>
                <br>
                Javascript has 3 ways to define variables. LET, VAR, and CONST<br>
                <br>
                LET is the typical variable definition (let x = 2) <br>
                <br>
                VAR is extremely similar to LET, but it automatically gets pushed to the top of the file (var x = 2).<br>
                <br>
                CONST is *kind of* similar to LET. It's shorthand for "constant", and it stores values like LET, but it can NEVER BE CHANGED! (const x = 2)
            </div>
            <div id="I">
                I stands for input/output<br>
                <br>
                Inputs are things that let the user interact with your website. Some inputs include text boxes, buttons, number inputs, and selections!
                Outputs are what you use to return data back to the user (for this class, that's typically using getElementById to change a div).
            </div>
            <div id="D">
                D stands for decisions. Decisions are if statements and else statements. "If" only runs the code if the specified condition is true.
                "Else" only runs the code if the specified condition from the "if" statement above it is false.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="E">
                E stands for events. They're stuff like "onclick", "onhover", and "onblur". They trigger Javascript code to run whenever your webpage is 
                interacted with in a specific way.
            </div>
            <div id="O">
                O stands for objects. Objects are variables that can store a bunch of different parameters. They're useful for defining specific instances of
                something if you want to give those instances a bunch of data.
            </div>
            <div id="F">
                F stands for functions. Functions store bits of Javascript code so they can be used repeatedly and make your code look nicer. They
                also accept parameters.
            </div>
            <div id="L">
                L stands for Loops. Loops are used to loop over a piece of Javascript. The three main kinds of loops in Javascript are "while" (which runs
                while the specified condition is true), "for" (which lets you use a counter to run code a certain amount of times), and "foreach" (which
                lets you iterate through arrays.) 
            </div>
            <div id="A">
                A stands for Arrays. Arrays are useful for when you have a bunch of data that you need to group together, but you don't need to refer
                to the data by name (because otherwise objects are better.)
            </div>
            <div id="C">
                C stands for classes. Classes in Javascript are more or less just objects with stricter rules while also having the ability to store functions.
                You can also extend a class to base one class off of another class.
            </div>
