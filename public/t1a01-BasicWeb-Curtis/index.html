    <main>
        <h1>Typical Elements you may see on the web.</h1>
        <p>
            HTML has <i><b>A LOT</b></i> of different elements! They provide the functionality for several websites you may be familiar with, such as 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>!    
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the sentence above contains &lt;p&gt; (paragrpah tag), &lt;i&gt; (italics), &lt;b&gt; (bold), and &lt;a&gt; (links)! <b style="color:red;"><i><u>You can also get creative and combine them to make monstrosities like this!</u></i></b> 
            However, you probably shouldn't do that because it looks awful and can be confused for links.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Another element type are headings! h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, etc! The larger the number, the smaller the heading (which totally isn't confusing!) This is an h3. The heading you see at the top of the page is an h1.
        </h3>
        <h6>
            This is an h6! Tiny, huh? Not that useful as a heading, but useful for subtitles!
        </h6>
        <h3>
            You can <u>also</u> put <i>styling</i> in headers! <s>Strikethrough</s>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Lastly for cool text styling elements, another thing you may have noticed are the colours on some bits of text. &lt;a&gt; adds colouring automatically, but you can also use CSS and do it yourself to create... <b><u><red>r</red><orange>a</orange><yellow>i</yellow><green>n</green><turquoise>b</turquoise><blue>o</blue><indigo>w</indigo><purple>s</purple><darkPurple>!</darkPurple></u></b>
        </p>
        <span>As for uncool text styling elements, this segment of text is divided up into 4 &lt;span&gt;s. It </span>
        <span>lets you display text inline! Although in reality it's just </span>
        <span>an empty tag with no code attatched to it, so while you can do stuff like <span id="spanT">T</span><span id="spanH">H</span><span id="spanI">I</span><span id="spanS">S</span> with spans, there's not much reason to </span>
        <span>use it since you can do it with other tags (the rainbow was done with custom tags, not spans)</span>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <marquee>Scrolling text :D</marquee>
        <p>
            This is a marquee! Pretty neat, huh? They've mostly fallen out of fashion in web development now because of how annoying they look, but they used to be
            a much bigger part of the web. It's like a news ticker! You can also put images in them to make them look EXTRA annoying! (but i've spared you of that because it's incredibly distracting)
        </p>
        <br>

        <div>
            One last thing to note of is &lt;div&gt;s! Divs let you divide up your webpage and add lots of cool CSS and JS to them! 
            As useful as divs are, you can use most HTML tags to serve the same purpose (this page is divided up into &lt;header&gt; and &lt;main&gt;, 
            which all do the exact same things as div, but they make your code a lot more readable and are good practice! Typically you'll also see &lt;footer&gt;, 
            but that's not used on this web page because this page has no footer.) They're very common in web page development, so it's 
            worth mentioning them as one of the basic elements as the web! 
        </div>

        <p>
            The divider line below this bit of text is called an &lt;hr&gt;! They're pretty nifty for making your web page's content look nice :D 
        </p>
