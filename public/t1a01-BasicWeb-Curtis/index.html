        <h1>Typical Elements you may see on the web.</h1>
        <p>
            HTML has <i><b>A LOT</b></i> of different elements! They provide the functionality for several websites you may be familiar with, such as 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>!    
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the sentence above contains &lt;p&gt; (paragrpah tag), &lt;i&gt; (italics), &lt;b&gt; (bold), and &lt;a&gt; (links)! <b style="color:red;"><i><u>You can also get creative and combine them to make monstrosities like this!</u></i></b> 
            However, you probably shouldn't do that because it looks awful and can be confused for links.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Another element type are headings! h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, etc! The larger the number, the smaller the heading (which totally isn't confusing!) This is an h3. The heading you see at the top of the page is an h1.
        </h3>
        <h6>
            This is an h6! Tiny, huh? Not that useful as a heading, but useful for subtitles!
        </h6>
        <p>
            Lastly for cool text styling elements, another thing you may have noticed are the colours on some bits of text. &lt;a&gt; adds colouring automatically, but you can also use CSS and do it yourself to create... <b><u><red>r</red><orange>a</orange><yellow>i</yellow><green>n</green><turquoise>b</turquoise><blue>o</blue><indigo>w</indigo><purple>s</purple><darkPurple>!</darkPurple></u></b>
        </p>
        <span>As for uncool text styling elements, this segment of text is divided up into 4 &lt;span&gt;s. It </span>
        <span>lets you display text inline! Although in reality it's just </span>
        <span>an empty tag with no code attatched to it, so while you can do stuff like <span id="spanT">t</span><span id="spanH">h</span><span id="spanI">i</span><span id="spanS">s</span> with spans, there's not much reason to </span>
        <span>use it over anything else (the rainbow was done with custom tags, not spans)</span>
