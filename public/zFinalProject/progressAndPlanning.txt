Planning:

    Make it like Wario Ware Incorporated
    Have the game controlled only using the mouse
    

    Game progression
        Intro cutscene 
            - Late for work
            - Running out of the house to work
        Mandatory Level 1 using ellis's template
            - Getting to work 
        Cutscene
            - Showing up at the reception
            - Boss is busy yelling at some other people for something stupidly minor
            - Boss sees you, is angry, and tells you to hop in the elevator and get to work
            - Boss tells you a few promotions may be in order if you get it done fast enough ("despite your tardiness, you've been a valuable asset to the company")
            - Hop in the elevator
            - Boss tells you to do all your work and then come up to floor 20 for a meeting
            - Boss's title is shown in the cutscene (foreshadowing for when you'll replace him)
            - Tutorial mentioning how you only need to use the mouse to get all your work done (thank IT for that)
        Microgame section
            - Rise to the top of the corporate ladder
            - Coffee is part of the speedup animation
            - Game over is getting fired
            - Level up is getting a major promotion
            - The level 2 and level 3 microgames 
        Boss microgame (floor 20)
            - You exit the elevator
            - Your current title is the one just below the boss's
            - Walking out of the elevator uses the same engine as the mandatory level 1
            - Boss is happy with your performance
            - You're in the corner office
            - Boss gives some speech about the true purpose of the company, and you're given the choice to either try and replace him or continue working for him (and his bad morality)
                - If you agree to keep working for him, you get the BAD ENDING 
                    - There's a button you can click to go back and get the good ending
                - If you disagree with the boss's morality, you go into a "boss"fight!!
                    - The boss flips his table and everything on it lands in front of you, giving the choice of weapons for the bossfight
                    - You're given the choice between a few different weapons
                        - Ballpoint blade (fast paced hack and slash, hollow knight)
                        - Paperclip whip / Keyboard and mace / Rotary phone whip (long range but slower, think something like the whip from spelunky but longer)
                        - Stapler boomerang/gun (ranged weapon. You can shoot mini paperclips or throw the whole stapler.)

                    - Starting the bossfight:
                        - The boss kicks his rolling chair forward for his first attack
                    - Boss has various attacks
                        - "YOU'RE FIRED" (fire attack)
                        - Hot coffee splash attack (maybe he drinks the coffee and speeds up for a second phase?)
                        - Shoulder dash
                        - Iron fist
                        - "The big wig" armor (?) (nvm this one is kinda bad)
                        - Final attack where he sends some major attack at you, but you send it back and it knocks him out of the window, ending the bossfight
                        
        Boss defeated section     
            - Once you defeat the boss, you knock him out the window, and he escapes using a golden parachute
            - You become the new boss
